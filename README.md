### SAZSORTER
SazSorter is a python script which sorts and moves files from a folder named "RandomFiles" to a folder named "SortedFiles".

### INSTRUCTIONS
Before you actually use this script or any other script which touches your files, make a backup!. By the way, this is speaking from experience! :o

Lets get to the actual instructions: 

<ol>
<li>Copy the files you want to sort with this script into the "RandomFiles" folder. If the folder doesn't exist, run the script first.</li>
<li>Once the files have been placed in the "RandomFiles" folder, run the script.</li>
<li>Your random files will now be in the "SortedFiles" folder.</li>
</ol>

### NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Sorting options by name/file type...
