# SazSorter

### What does it do?
The execution of 'app.py' allows files from the 'RandomFiles' folder, to be transfered into the 'SortedFiles' folders subfolder, which gets automatically created depending on the date the file being transfered was created. 

### Why did I create this?
I needed to learn how python handles creating/deleting/moving files. I had bunch of files laying around in one of my folders, and instead of doing this by hand, I decided to create a script that does it automatically for me.

### What would I like to add to this?
I want to add a GUI interface as that is what I have been looking into recently. It would allow you to choose the output folder and few other options for sorting out the files, such as name, modified-date, creation-date and file-size.
