# SazSorter

### The Function
<ol>
<li>Create the required folders for file transfer. (RandomFiles & SortedFiles)</li>
<li>Get all files from the RandomFiles folder.</li>
<li>Copy files from RandomFiles folder to the SortedFiles folder, creating a new folder with the date (file creation date) of the file being transfered.</li>
</ol>

### Reason of creation
Tired of moving all the items manually, I decided to automate it using python.  

### How to use
<ol>
<li>Copy unsorted files into the RandomFiles folder. If the folder does not exist, then run the app.py with python, as it will create the required folders.</li>
<li>Run app.py file with python.</li>
<li>Sorted files will now be in the SortedFiles folder.</li>
</ol>

### Needed improvements / features
- More file sorting options, such as sorting by name, file type.
- Graphical user interface.
